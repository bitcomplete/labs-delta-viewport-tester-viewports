# Labs: Viewport Tester Viewports
This repository contains a JSON file (see `viewports.json`) which lists modern / up-to-date viewports. This is used extensively in our product [https://viewport-tester.com/](https://viewport-tester.com/), which allows you to quickly test viewports and breakpoints for your website / webpage.

Feel free to use this data (licensed under MIT) for your own projects (and submit a PR to this `README.md` file so we can link to your project).

Additionally, we're sure our list of devices / viewports is missing some. If so, please submit a PR so we can maintain this JSON database of viewports.
